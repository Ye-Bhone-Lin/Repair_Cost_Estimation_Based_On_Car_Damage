# Repair_Cost_Estimation_Based_On_Car_Damage

### 🚗 Overview

This project is designed for insurance companies to automate and streamline the process of estimating repair costs for damaged vehicles. Using AI-powered image analysis, the system detects damaged parts of a car and provides an estimated repair cost, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.

### 🔍 Features

- AI-Based Damage Detection: Uses a YOLO model to identify damaged car parts.

- Automated Cost Estimation: Provides repair cost estimates based on detected damage.

- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy image upload and result visualization.

- Fast & Scalable: Handles multiple claims efficiently, making it ideal for insurance companies.

### Dataset

The dataset was collected and annotated manually using Roboflow. It consists of:

- 100 training images

- 15 validation images

- 30 testing images

This dataset is used to train and evaluate the YOLO model for car damage detection.


### 🛠 How It Works

1. Upload an image of a damaged car.

2. The YOLO model detects damaged parts.

3. The app matches detected damage with repair cost data.

4. Estimated repair costs are displayed to the user.

Here is the demostration:
